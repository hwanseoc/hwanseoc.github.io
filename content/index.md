# Hello! 👋

My name is **Hwanseo Choi**. I'm a **[cuDNN Library](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/technologies/cudnn/) Engineer at NVIDIA** in Santa Clara, California, where I work on cutting-edge deep learning infrastructure and GPU-accelerated computing.

### 💼 Experience

* **Deep Learning Library Software Engineer @ [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com)**  
  → Added depthwise convolution kernels to [cuDNN](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/technologies/cudnn/), developed C++/Python frontend for Scaled-Dot Product Attention, expanded testing and reference for multiple variants, and helped integrate cuDNN Scaled-Dot Product Attention into various deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, JAX, and TransformerEngine.

* **Course Assistant @ [UIUC](https://illinois.edu)**  
  → Developed autograders, created documentation, held office hours, and graded programming assignments for ECE 220: Introduction to Computer Systems.

### 🎓 Education

* I received my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering** from the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**. My coursework included topics in parallel programming, artificial intelligence, operating systems, computer architecture, digital systems, and interactive graphics.

### 🧪 Projects

* **[MXNet Convolution](https://github.com/hwanseoc/mxnet-convolution)** — CUDA kernel optimization and convolution operator extension; won first place in performance competition
* **Dancing Altera Revolution** — DDR-style game on Altera NIOS II FPGA using VGA & sound card drivers
* **[Ray Tracing with BVH](https://github.com/hwanseoc/ray-tracer)** — 3D ray tracer in C++ with GLM, 10× speedup using BVH (binary space partitioning)
* **[Twitch Prediction Tools](https://github.com/hwanseoc/tpt-public)** — Bot using Twitch GraphQL + Riot API to predict match outcomes and farm points
* **[Live Chess Analyzer](https://github.com/hwanseoc/chess-vision)** — Converts screenshots into FEN, overlays engine evaluations visually in real time

### 🛠 Skills

* Linux, C/C++, Python, PyTorch, CUDA, cuBLAS, cuDNN, CMake, Docker

### 🌍 Languages

* English and Korean
